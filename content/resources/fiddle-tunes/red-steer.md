### Notes
Red Steer is a very high energy tune! I learned this tune from Bruce Molskey and it is one of my favorites. I usually play it similar to him but in sqaure time. In the video below, they leave out a count in the C-Part.

This is one of the best old time fiddle videos on youtube! Brittnay Hass & Bruce Molsky are some of the all-time greats of old-time fiddle. I would highly recroment their online lessons.
