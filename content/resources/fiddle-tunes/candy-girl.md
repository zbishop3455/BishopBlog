### Notes
**Bask in the glory of Uncle Bunt Stephens!** This is an absolute classic fiddle tune which teaches players the spirit of the *old-time pulse.* This tune personally unlocked a lot of the old-time bowing patterns in my playing. I use this tune as a warm-up and exercise in bowing. Welcome to your first "Hillbilly Trance" song.

While the structure of the song is just a drone of the root note and some pentonic action, it is very possible to sprinkle in IV and V chords where you feel. Do not let the simple structure limit you. Just about anything sounds good on this tune!
