### Notes
Yet another classic with many different versions! This is nice Round Peak style song that I learned from Tommy Jarrell (Via Bruce Molsky). This tune can be tricky because of the somewhat asymetrical structure but that is also what makes it so good. Recently I have been absolutely obsessed with Stephanie Coleman's version where the old-time pulse bowing is stripped down to its roots. I have been trying to reproduce this and I can never get it to the same level!
