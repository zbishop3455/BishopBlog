## The domain
Back in *2018*, I noticed that *zacharybishop.com* was still available. Without hesitation, I reached for the credit card and purchased it.

 As a student of computing with a biblical name, it was clear that oprotunities like this were are an few between. It would only be a matter of time before the other *Zachary Bishops* of the world swooped up this precous dominn and used it for themselves!...
 
 What if they did not do the name justice? What if they their hobbies did not reflect mine? What if a nosy recruiter googled my name just to find a cake designer's website instead of a hungry student awaiting his dream job? 

 Or worse, what if a ***javascript in the backend*** enthusiest took over this wonderful domain to ***spread the devil's song***...

 Unfortunately, I let this domain sit vacant for 6 years before building this blog. This has been a great dis-service to all of the other Zachary Bishops of the world.

 **To the other Zachary Bishops of the world:**
 1. I am sorry I bought this domain before you 
 2. I will probably keep this domain until I die
 3. I will honor our name to all those who google it!
