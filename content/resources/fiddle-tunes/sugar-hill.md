### Notes
Sugar Hill is one of my all-time favorites and one of the first tunes I learned (even before I started play fiddle). Over the years I have played it in many styles. I originally fell in love with an old VHS ripped video of the Freight Hoppers playing this tune. The fiddler (David Bass) has a very unique way of bowing the tune that I am in love with. It has taken me many years to start understanding how to get the poly-rythms in his bowing. Most are still out of my ability.

Recently I have enjoyed playing the tune in the style of **Rayna Gellert** which is a little slower and has more control in the bowing. The GOAT **Tommy Jarrel** has probably the most classic version.

The Tune can be played by substituting the **IV** chord with a minor **vi** chord for a different flavor!
